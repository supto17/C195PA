<p>Title: Western Governors University Software 2 Final Project. Advanced Java Concepts.</p> 

### Purpose

<p>Throughout your career in software design and development, you will be asked to create applications with various features and criteria based on a variety of business requirements. 
For this assessment, you will create your own GUI-based Java application with requirements that mirror those you will likely encounter in a real-world job assignment. </p>

<p>The skills you will showcase in this assessment are also directly relevant to technical interview questions for future employment. This application may become a portfolio piece for you to show to future employers.</p>

<p>Several attachments and links have been included to help you complete this task. The attached “Database ERD” shows the entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this database, which you can reference as you create your application.
For this task, you will use the Performance Assessment Lab Area accessed by the Performance Assessment Lab Area in the web link to access the virtual lab environment to complete this task. The preferred integrated development environment (IDE) for this 
assignment is IntelliJ IDEA (Community Edition). If you choose to use another IDE, you must export your project into NetBeans 11.1 or 
later, or IntelliJ format, or your submission will be returned. This assessment also requires the following software: the latest long term support (LTS) version of JDK, JavaFX SDK, and Scene Builder which are also available the Performance Assessment Lab Area.</p>

<p>Your submission should include a zip file with all the necessary code files to compile, support, and run your application. Your submission should also include an index.html file with reflective Javadoc comments in the .java files. 
The zip file submission must keep the project file and folder structure intact for the IDE. </p>
